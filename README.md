# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
I played around with adding a background color, which took me a while to figure out since it had to be a separate wrapper for the profile box. I wanted to center the entire thing on my screen, but I was not able to figure out which margins were in control of that.
